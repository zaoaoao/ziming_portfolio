            different from my previous work, I shifted the focus from space(a room) to object. in this work, I took
            photos of all visible surfaces of a table(shown in the last photo): top, legs, edges, corners, etc. I used
            these photos to reassemble the table on paper, rebuild three dimensional object on plane surface. rules of

        <figcaption>project “toilet” focused only on toilet, an white and ceramic object.

            started same as previous works, i took photos of every inch of toilet, collaged these images to construct a
            complete toilet on paper. (3, 6, 7)
            in the next step, i evened the difference of light, which caused difference of brightness and darkness in
            photo, toilet became a white color block. (4)
            after this i changed the medium of work(from paper to ceramic, which is normally the raw material of
            toilet), to get a flattened ceramic toilet, and originally it should be one piece of white ceramic
            piece(similar with image 4), but it was broken into pieces accidentally. (1)
            and i collaged the original photos three dimensionally. (5)
            at the end, i replaced the paper photo with ceramic plates that has same shape, built a three dimensional
            ceramic toilet. same as the toilet we see, it’s touchable, white and made of ceramic. the camera, became a
            transfer point of these two toilets. (2)

        <figcaption>my first typeface design

            in this typeface, i deconstruct the letters into parts by how visually they look without considering how
            they are written, and rebuild new-structured letters by using two different type of hand-drawn lines.
            because of huge contrast of thin line(initial inspiration is curves of hair) and chaotic line, the structure
            of letter became more unbalanced and unrecognizable.
            this typeface has three different weights and for each weight I designed five different variations(not shown
            in this post), to have more possibilities of typography.å
