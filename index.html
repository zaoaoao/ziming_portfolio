        <figcaption><span class="title">SUGGESTION FOR YOU</span> is a series of book-like screen-printed pieces created
            on plastic, wooden, and
            ceramic plates.

            In this work, I recreated the “books” from book design posts that were suggested in my Instagram feed. The
            rule I set for myself was to rely only on my memory—I wasn't allowed to revisit the original posts. As a
            result, the text in my versions does not make sense, since I could not recall the original content, and many
            design details differ from the originals.
            Beyond design, material choice also became an issue. On Instagram, books are often presented as clean,
            cube-like objects with covers, or sometimes only as scanned images of their covers. Based on these images, I
            can only assume they are made of paper. But is that assumption necessarily true? In my recreation, I
            responded to this uncertainty by using alternative materials that are not commonly associated with books.

            screen printing is an important part of this project. it requires manual actions, which are always imperfect
            and therefore visible from the results: the text is often blurry, color is uneven, contents on different
            sides are misaligned, and ink frequently attracts dirt.

            this project is about the process of digital posts permeate our design practices, along with their
            limitations.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>in this my first typeface design, i deconstruct the letters into parts by how visually they look
            without considering how
            they are written, and rebuild new-structured letters by using two different type of hand-drawn lines.
            because of huge contrast of thin line(initial inspiration is curves of hair) and chaotic line, the structure
            of letter became more unbalanced and unrecognizable.
            this typeface has three different weights and for each weight I designed five different variations(not shown
            in this post), to have more possibilities of typography.

        <figcaption>parkett is a contemporary art magazine. in 2017 it published its closing print issue in response to
            people's
            digital reading habits.
            therefore, blending parkett's print legacy with digital content is basic concept of this redesigned edition:
            original articles appear right-side up; flipped, they reveal embedded social media snippets from instagram,
            pinterest, or google. mismatched images and false footnotes disrupt expectations, mirroring online
            information's unreliability—a reflection of how we consume art today.

        <figcaption>product information (I AM VISIBLE)
            a zine inspired by Katarina Jazbec's YOU CAN'T AUTOMATE ME (2021), a flim about the port workers.

            port workers usually need to wear various safety gear, such as safety shoes, helmets, and gloves. however,
            in a port filled with stacked shipping containers, faced with iron sheets, steel bars, and concrete, these
            protective measures seem insignificant. confronted with these industrial machines and materials, we truly
            see the fragility of the human body.

            at the same time, when workers put on their uniforms, what we see are prepared workers, not individuals with
            their own emotions and experiences. work uniforms objectify us.

            based on these ideas, in this zine, I want to express the vast gap between humans and machines, humans and
            products, and how we fall into the trap of dehumanization.

        <figcaption>project “toilet” focused only on toilet, an white and ceramic object.

            started same as previous works, i took photos of every inch of toilet, collaged these images to construct a
            complete toilet on paper.
            in the next step, i evened the difference of light, which caused difference of brightness and darkness in
            photo, toilet became a white color block.
            after this i changed the medium of work(from paper to ceramic, which is normally the raw material of
            toilet), to get a flattened ceramic toilet, and originally it should be one piece of white ceramic
            piece(similar with image 4), but it was broken into pieces accidentally.
            and i collaged the original photos three dimensionally.
            at the end, i replaced the paper photo with ceramic plates that has same shape, built a three dimensional
            ceramic toilet. same as the toilet we see, it's touchable, white and made of ceramic. the camera, became a
            transfer point of these two toilets.
